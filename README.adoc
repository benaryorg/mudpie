= Mudpie

:app: Mudpie


== Overview

{app} is a simple multi-threaded HTTP application server for the amazingly
awesome Rust language.  It is inspired by python's lean and elegant WSGI
protocol.

{app} is written in 100% safe Rust code (no unsafe blocks) and has no
dependencies.  It is intended to be reliable and easy to audit for security,
especially for embedded applications.

NOTE: The {app} `master` branch is for Rust nightly.  


== Try it out

Use +cargo run+ to start the included demo server, which displays some example
pages you can visit at  +http://localhost:8000/+.

== Example Code

    return WebResponse::new_html(page);
}

fn main() {
    let mut svr = WebServer::new();
    svr.add_path("get", "/hello", hello);
    svr.run("127.0.0.1", 8000);
