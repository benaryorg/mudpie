= Ferrite

== Overview

Ferrite is a multi-threaded HTTP application server for the Rust language.

Ferrite is not intended to be a front end.  A front end, like nginx, handles
SSL termination and request/response buffering, and is typically event-driven
for scalability.  

== Implementation

Ferrite is multi threaded: it has one main thread and N worker threads.  If a
worker thread panics, the main thread will notice (immediately) and spawn
another worker thread.  If the main thread panics (e.g. because spawning a new
worker fails), the entire process will abort.  

A higher level watchdog process, like systemd, should monitor and restart the
Ferrite process(es) if they fail.

Each worker thread independently calls +accept()+ and runs its own processing
loop; the main thread is not bothered and there is no overhead of context
switching between threads.
